# This is good stuff, let's practice some more with files.
# There are two files in this folder to work with, do not
# directly edit either of those.  Your program should be
# doing all the work.

# first open up blank.txt, make sure to specify 'write' mode

blank =

# also, open up antiblank.txt in write mode

antiblank = 

# I want blank.txt to be blank!  Wipe it out with truncate()

XXX CODE HERE

# I have content in antiblank.txt, but I need to start fresh,
# so wipe it with truncate() as well.

XXX CODE HERE

# Now, let's write a line back into antiblank.txt.
# Let's write 'Testing, testing, 123' back into the file.

antiblank.write(XXX CODE HERE)

# See how that works?
# Now add one more line of any content you want.


# Lastly, print the contents of antiblank.txt

XXX CODE HERE

# Also close the file.
