# This is good stuff, let's practice some more with files.
# There are two files in this folder to work with, do not
# directly edit either of those.  Your program should be
# doing all the work.

# first open up blank.txt, make sure to specify 'write' mode

blank = 

# Let's make sure 'blank.txt' is blank by calling truncate() on it

# also, open up antiblank.txt in read mode

antiblank = 

# Now, let's write a line into antiblank.txt.
# Let's write 'Testing, testing, 123' back into the file.

antiblank.write(XXX CODE GOES HERE)

# See how that works?
# Now add one more line of any content you want.

antiblank.write(XXX CODE GOES HERE)

# Lastly, print the contents of antiblank.txt


# Also close the file.
