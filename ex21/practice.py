# Okay, let's write some functions that return stuff.
# Remember, instead of printing the result, you'lll
# want to use the keyword 'return'.

# First define a function that takes an input and
# returns 2 no matter what.

def returns_2(x):
	XXX Finish it

# Now define a function that returns its input plus 2

def plus_two(x):
	XXX Finish it

# Now define a function that returns its input times itself

def square(x):
	XXX Finish it

# Now define a function that takes two strings and concatenates them.
# In other words, puts them together.

def concat(first_string, second_string):
	XXX Finish it

# Now define a function that compares two integers to see if the first
# is greater than the second.

def compare_greater_than(first_integer, second_integer):
	XXX Finish it
