Leaping from tree to tree! As they
float down the mighty rivers of
British Columbia! With my best girl
by my side!
The Larch!
The Pine!
The Giant Redwood Tree!
The Sequoia!
The Little Whopping Rule Tree!
We'd sing! Sing! Sing!

Oh, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay,
I sleep all night and I work all day.
