# We're going to do some basic file practice here.
# I've made a file in this directory called 'witch.txt'
# In this exercise, I want you to open the file,
# read it's contents to a variable and then print
# that variable to the screen.

txt = open(XXX) # put the correct filename in

contents = 			# read the file and assign to this variable

# Last, print its contents to the screen
