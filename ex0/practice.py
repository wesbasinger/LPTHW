# You actually won't be writing any Python code in this exercise,
# instead you will be doing some of the directory and command line
# tasks that are listed in the exercise.  After you're done, type
# "python validate.py" (without the quotes) on a command line or
# terminal window to check yourself.  Next lesson will explain how
# to execute programs more.

# TASK 1

# Make sure you get it exactly the same, line breaks and all.
