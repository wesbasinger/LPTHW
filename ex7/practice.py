# We'll work on some sring multiplication in this exercise.
# I'm not really sure that's what it's called, but oh well...

# make the following code changes so that 'combined' equals
# "PouncePouncePouncePounce"

word = "Pounce"
combined = 		# make your declaration here

# make 'line_sep' = "=================" by using the new
# technique

char = 				# make this declaration / should be a string
num_times = 		# and this one too / should be an int

line_sep = char * num_times # don't change this line


# How about a fancier verision?
# Make 'fancy' = '+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-'

pattern = 			# make this declaration
repeat = 			# this one as well

together =
