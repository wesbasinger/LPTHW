            <h1 class="title">Exercise 0: The Setup</h1>
            <p>This exercise has no code.  It is simply the exercise you complete to get your computer to run Python.   You should follow these instructions as exactly as possible.  For example, Mac OS X computers already have Python 2, so do not install Python 3 (or any Python).</p>

<p>Do the following tasks to complete this exercise:</p>

<li>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/</a> with your browser, get the <tt class="docutils literal">TextWrangler</tt> text editor, and install it.</li>
<li>Put <tt class="docutils literal">TextWrangler</tt> (your editor) in your dock so you can reach it easily.</li>
<li>Find your Terminal program.  Search for it.  You will find it.</li>
<li>Put your Terminal in your dock as well.</li>
<li>Run your Terminal program.  It won't look like much.</li>
<li>In your Terminal program, run <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt>.  You run things in Terminal by just typing the name and hitting RETURN.</li>
<li>Type <tt class="docutils literal">quit()</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Enter</tt>, and get out of <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt>.</li>
<li>You should be back at a prompt similar to what you had before you typed <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt>.  If not, find out why.</li>
<li>Learn how to make a directory in the Terminal.</li>
<li>Learn how to change into a directory in the Terminal.</li>
<li>Use your editor to create a file in this directory.  You will make the file, &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As...,&quot; and pick this directory.</li>
<li>Go back to Terminal using just the keyboard to switch windows.</li>
<li>Back in Terminal, list the directory with <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt> to see your newly created file.</li>

<h1>Finding Things on the Internet</h1>
<p>A major part of this book is learning to research programming topics online.  I'll tell you to &quot;search for this on the internet,&quot; and your job is to use a search engine to find the answer.  The reason I have you search instead of just giving you the answer is because I want you to be an independent learner who does not need my book when you're done with it.  If you can find the answers to your questions online then you are one step closer to not needing me, and that is my goal.</p>
<p>Thanks to search engines such as Google you can easily find anything I tell you to find.  If I say, &quot;search online for the python list functions&quot; then you simply do this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</a></li>
<li>Type: <tt class="docutils literal">python list functions</tt></li>
<li>Read the websites listed to find the best answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a screenshot of me doing this search:</p>

<h1>Warnings for Beginners</h1>
<p>You are done with this exercise.  This exercise might be hard for you depending on your familiarity with your computer.  If it is difficult, take the time to read and study and get through it, because until you can do these very basic things you will find it difficult to get much programming done.</p>
<p>If someone tells you to stop at a specific exercise in this book or to skip certain ones, you should ignore that person.  Anyone trying to hide knowledge from you, or worse, make you get it from them instead of through your own efforts, is trying to make you depend on them for your skills.  Don't listen to them and do the exercises anyway so that you learn how to educate yourself.</p>
<p>If a programmer tells you to use <tt class="docutils literal">vim</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">emacs</tt>, just say &quot;no.&quot;  These editors are for when you are a better programmer.  All you need right now is an editor that lets you put text into a file.  We will use <tt class="docutils literal">gedit</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">TextWrangler</tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal">Notepad++</tt> (from now on called &quot;the text editor&quot; or &quot;a text editor&quot;) because it is simple and the same on all computers.  Professional programmers use these text editors so it is good enough for you starting out.</p>
<p>A programmer may try to get you to install Python 3 and learn that.  Say, &quot;When all of the Python code on your computer is Python 3, then I'll try to learn it.&quot;  That should keep them busy for about 10 years.  I repeat, <em>do not use Python 3</em>.  Python 3 is not used very much, and if you learn Python 2 you can easily learn Python 3 when you need it.  If you learn Python 3 then you'll still have to learn Python 2 to get anything done.  Just learn Python 2 and ignore people saying Python 3 is the future.</p>
<p>A programmer will eventually tell you to use Mac OS X or Linux.  If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they'll tell you to get a Mac OS X computer.  If he likes control and has a huge beard, he will (or ze will if you prefer non-gendered pronouns of humans with beards) tell you to install Linux.  Again, use whatever computer you have right now that works.  All you need is an editor, a Terminal, and Python.</p>
<p>Finally, the purpose of this setup helps you do three things very reliably while you work on the exercises:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>Write</em> exercises using your text editor, <tt class="docutils literal">gedit</tt> on Linux, <tt class="docutils literal">TextWrangler</tt> on OS X, or <tt class="docutils literal">Notepad++</tt> on Windows.</li>
<li><em>Run</em> the exercises you wrote.</li>
<li><em>Fix</em> them when they are broken.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything else will only confuse you, so stick to the plan.</p>
