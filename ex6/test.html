            <h1 class="title">Exercise 6: Strings and Text</h1>
            <p>While you have been writing strings, you still do not know what they do.  In this exercise we create a bunch of variables with complex strings so you can see what they are for.  First an explanation of strings.</p>
<p>A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or &quot;export&quot; out of the program you are writing.  Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt> (double-quotes) or <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt> (single-quotes) around the text.  You saw this many times with your use of <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt> after the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> to print the string.</p>
<p>Strings may contain the format characters you have discovered so far.  You simply put the formatted variables in the string, and then a <tt class="docutils literal">%</tt> (percent) character, followed by the variable.  The <em>only</em> catch is that if you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables, you need to put them inside <tt class="docutils literal">( )</tt> (parenthesis) separated by <tt class="docutils literal">,</tt> (commas).  It's as if you were telling me to buy you a list of items from the store and you said, &quot;I want milk, eggs, bread, and soup.&quot;  Only as a programmer we say, &quot;(milk, eggs, bread, soup).&quot;</p>
<p>We will now type in a whole bunch of strings, variables, and formats, and print them.  You will also practice using short abbreviated variable names.  Programmers love saving time at your expense by using annoyingly short and cryptic variable names, so let's get you started reading and writing them early on.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What is the difference between <tt class="docutils literal">%r</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">%s</tt>?</dt>
<dd>Use the <tt class="docutils literal">%r</tt> for debugging, since it displays the &quot;raw&quot; data of the variable, but the others are used for displaying to users.</dd>
<dt>What's the point of <tt class="docutils literal">%s</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">%d</tt> when you can just use <tt class="docutils literal">%r</tt>?</dt>
<dd>The <tt class="docutils literal">%r</tt> is best for debugging, and the other formats are for actually displaying variables to users.</dd>
<dt>I get the error <tt class="docutils literal">TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting</tt>.</dt>
<dd>You need to make sure that the line of code is exactly the same. What happens in this error is you have more <tt class="docutils literal">%</tt> format characters in the string than variables to put in them.  Go back and figure out what you did wrong.</dd>
<dt>Why do you put <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt> (single-quotes) around some strings and not others?</dt>
<dd>Mostly it's because of style, but I'll use a single-quote inside a string that has double-quotes.  Look at line 10 to see how I'm doing that.If you thought the joke was funny could you write <tt class="docutils literal">hilarious = True</tt>?
Yes, and you'll learn more about these boolean values in Exercise 27.</dd>
