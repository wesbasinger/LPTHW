# Fix the code below so that the single and double quotes are escaped.

first_ex = "I am 6'2" tall."  # escape double-quote inside string
second_ex = 'I am 6'2" tall.'  # escape single-quote inside string

print first_ex # Should print "I am 6'2" tall."
print second_ex # Should print 'I am 6'2" tall.'


#Modify backslash_cat so that 'a' is surrounded by backslashes.
backslash_cat = "I'm \ a \ cat."

print backslash_cat
