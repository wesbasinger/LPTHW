# Alright, this is going to be fun. Let's practice
# with some lists and for loops.

# First, let's define some lists.
# Make a list below that has every odd number up to 15.
# Do me a favor and put it in ascending order, order matters on lists.

odds_to_15 = 

# Let's do another one.
# Make a list of all the colors in the American flag.
# Don't worry about the order, I'll deal with sorting.

colors_of_flag = 

# And one last list.
# Make a list that has one string, one integer, 
# and one Boolean - in that order!

assorted = 

# Now let's practice looping through those lists.
# write a for loop that will print every element in the odds_to_15 list



# Make a loop that will print "XXX is a color in the American flag." for
# every element of colors_of_flag


twenties = []

# Write a for loop that will fill twenties with every single
# number from 20 - 29
