# In this practice, you'll do exactly what was in the
# exercise reading and in the interactive practice -
# copy one file to another.

# You'll be moving text from 'alpha.txt' to 'bravo.txt'
# 'alpha.txt' has text and 'bravo.txt' is empty

# First, open 'alpha.txt' in read mode

alpha = 

# Second open 'bravo.txt' in write mode

bravo = 

# Now read the content of alpha



# Now write that data to bravo


# Now close both files
