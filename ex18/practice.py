# This is going to get a lot more fun for me now.
# Now you can define functions and I can call them
# to test them.  Great stuff.

# First, finish the function defintion below to make
# the function print it's argument one time.

def one_time(argument):
	pass # delete this line fix it

# Second, finish this function definition to make
# only the second argument print

def one_of_two(first, second):
	pass # fix this line

# Lastly, make a function named dependable that 
# prints 'Depends' every time it's called

WRITE THE WHOLE THING

# Now call all three functions, in order
